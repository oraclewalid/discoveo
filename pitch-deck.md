# Discoveo

## AI-Powered Growth Intelligence

---

## The Problem

**CRO teams are drowning in data but starving for insights.**

- Analytics tools show *what* happened
- They never tell you *why*
- Qualitative data (surveys, interviews, session recordings) lives in silos
- Connecting the dots takes days of manual work

**Result:** Slow decisions, missed opportunities, wasted ad spend.

---

## The Cost

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Manual funnel analysis | 4-8 hours per report |
| Finding "why" behind drop-offs | Digging through 10+ tools |
| Identifying growth levers | Guesswork, not data |
| CRO specialist salary | €60-100k/year |

**Companies spend €50k+/year on analytics tools and still make gut decisions.**

---

## The Solution

**Discoveo: AI that connects your data and tells you why.**

1. **Connect** - Pull data from GA4 automatically
2. **Enrich** - Upload qualitative data (surveys, transcripts)
3. **Analyze** - AI finds patterns across quant + qual
4. **Act** - Prioritized recommendations by severity

**From "what happened" to "why and what to do" in minutes, not days.**

## How It Works

```

│   GA4 API   │────▶│  Discoveo   │────▶│  Dashboard  │
└─────────────┘     │   AI Core   │     │ + Insights  │

**AI analyzes funnel drop-offs + searches qualitative data to explain WHY.**
